## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - A repository would be a digital directory holding all of your projects, files, and all of your versions saved for you. 

 * Git - Version Control - Git is a version control software. Version control is a method of using version control software to allow multiple developers to make changes on a cloned remote version of a main project wihout overwriting eachothers changes.

 * Clone - A git clone is a copy of an already existing git repository. 

 * Fork - Forking is basically adding a copy of an existing repository to your personal profile to be used as a remote. 

 * History - Git history, also known as commits, can be described as a graph of snapshots of the entire repositoty. 

 * Staging - staging is the step before the commit in a git repository. This is the git add <file name> or git add . step. 

 * Remote - A git remote is the location of the storage of code you have created. Github gives us a URL of this.

 * Commit - A commit is basically a recording of the changes you, as a developer, have made to the repository. 

 * Push - A git push is the pushing of the commits made to your local branch to a remote repository.
